You can try this => https://notaddtry.github.io/test_funbox/

In this case I reilized nothing more,but working with react+redux and added some custom styling.

To test this a your locale do these steps:

1)clone this repo

2)run this at your terminal "npm init"

3)run this at your terminal "npm run start"

You can try change some initialState at store/store.js and try to add/remove available properties in objects.

See ya
